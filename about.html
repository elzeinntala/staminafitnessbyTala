          <p>Founder</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Stamina Fitness Center opened its doors in 2025 under the core belief that everyone possesses some type of strength waiting to be unlocked. We have a profound belief that movement is much more than just a workout or exercise routine; it is a form that enables one to explore their identity, strengthen themselves, and above all, smiling back in joy. No matter what the starting point is, be it personal obstacles or self-doubt, this space has been constructed with the vision of helping everyone rise and continuously uplift themselves. One of our guiding phrases includes ‘Your body is capable. Your mind just needs to believe it.’

            We have trainers who will remind you that every step matters, whether it’s walking into your very first dance class, lifting weights for the first time ever or returning back after an injury. Stamina invites you to redefine what progress feels, looks, or sounds like outside of just numbers or weight loss. The transformation comes from the newfound confidence, recovery, and feeling great in the skin you’re in. With the understanding that fitness is unique, just like your personality, we offer programs that mix dance, martial arts, mobility, strength, and wellness. Give your body and mind the chance to build stamina with us, and together, we won’t just train. Together, we will transform.</p>

                <p> For me, every form of movement is a language of its own.<br> Every creative movement comes distinctly and uniquely: ballet, hip-hop, and even belly-dance. I began learning how to dance at a young age, and for me, 
                    movement was and still is, an expression of everything I lack the words to explain or articulate.<br>
                    Each form of movement or dance came equipped with a feeling and emotion. For me personally, dance serves more than just one purpose; it enables me to reunite with myself, it fuels my creative side, and most importantly, it serves as my form of escape.
                     And then much later, I had the chance to step foot in martial arts; this is one of the lessons or skills I picked up from there: control, discipline and power. In other words, martial arts taught me that there is more to strength than bare physical aspects:
                     Softness and fierceness can exist in the same fragile body, which makes everything so much more beautiful.


                     <stron>That’s where Stamina was born.</stron>
                    The word stamina is often defined as
                    <strong>“the ability to sustain prolonged physical or mental effort.”</strong><br>
                    It sounds tough and it is but it’s also beautiful.<br>
                    Because in every workout, every class, every time I kept going when I wanted to stop…
                    That’s when I felt most alive.<br>
                    I chose the name Stamina because it represents everything I’ve experienced through movement 
                    endurance, emotion, recovery, and resilience. It’s not just a name. It’s my story.<br>
                    I built Stamina Fitness Center with one goal:
                    To help others feel what I’ve felt, the fire that lights up when you discover your own strength.<br>
                    I do this for the passion.
                    I do this because I believe everyone has a reason to keep going.
                    And if I can help just one person believe in themselves again<br><strong>-That's what Stamina
                        is truly about.</strong></p>
